### About The Project
**Tool used: Python**

---
In this project, the goal was to predict the sales of stores located in the USA with the help of machine learning techniques. 

**Kaggle Notebook Link:**

This dataset contains information about Sales Values in Dollars of American Stores between 2010 and 2011. In particular, this dataset contains:

- Stores' Area, State, Region, and Size;
- Products' ID, Description, Type, Category, and Sale Date;
- Accounting Info, such as Budget Margin, Profit, Total Expenses, and Marking.

**The steps involved were as:**
1. Cleaned the data e.g.
- Changed the date datatype and format.
- Dropped some irrelevant columns.
2. Visualized various features through different plots, e.g. **regression plot, histogram, line plot,**, etc.
3. Build a machine-learning model using the machine-learning technique **(Random Forest Regressor)**.
- Calculated and plotted **mutual information score** for discrete & continuous features.
- Did preprocessing and label encoding of data using **StandardScaler** and **LabelEncoder** respectively.
- Finally, created a predictive model using Random Forest Regressor.
